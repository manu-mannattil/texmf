\section{Quotations}

\thetitle

\theheadtitle

To typeset quotations, use the \verb|rightquote| environment and the \verb|quotee| command.
The environment styling was partially inspired by Knuth's \emph{The Art of Computer Programming}.
For instance, the listing below

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{rightquote}
  The formulation is mathematically
  equivalent to the more usual
  formulations.  There are, therefore, no
  fundamentally new results.  However,
  there is a pleasure in recognizing old
  things from a new point of view.

  \quotee{--- Richard P.~Feynman,
  Rev.~Mod.~Phys.~\textbf{20}, 367 (1948)}
  \end{rightquote}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would render as\ldots

\begin{rightquote}
The formulation is mathematically
equivalent to the more usual
formulations.  There are, therefore, no
fundamentally new results.  However,
there is a pleasure in recognizing old
things from a new point of view.

\quotee{--- Richard P.~Feynman, Rev.~Mod.~Phys.~\textbf{20}, 367 (1948)}
\end{rightquote}

A quote with equations...

\begin{rightquote}
  A famous equation in physics is $E^{2} = p^{2}{c}^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$.

  \quotee{--- Math is not in the right font}
\end{rightquote}


But sometimes, it's important to manually introduce linebreaks, e.g., to typeset poetry, as in the example below.

\begin{rightquote}
They fuck you up, your mum and dad.\\
  They may not mean to, but they do.\\
They fill you with the faults they had\\
  And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn\\
  By fools in old-style hats and coats,\\
Who half the time were soppy-stern\\
  And half at one another's throats.

Man hands on misery to man.\\
  It deepens like a coastal shelf.\\
Get out as early as you can,\\
  And don't have any kids yourself.

  \quotee{--- Philip Larkin, \emph{``This Be The Verse''}}
\end{rightquote}\par

A \verb|rightquote| environment ends a paragraph.
But there's extra vertical space after the quote and a new paragraph.

Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago---never mind how long precisely---
having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to
interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see
the watery part of the world.
It is a way I have of driving off the
spleen and regulating the circulation.
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people's hats off---then, I account it high time to get to sea as
soon as I can.

\begin{standout}
\begin{example}[A trignometric identity]
  Show that $\cos{2\theta} = 2\cos^{2}{\theta} - 1$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  We know $\cos(\theta_{1} + \theta_{2}) = \cos{\theta_{1}}\cos{\theta_{2}} - \sin{\theta_{1}}\sin{\theta_{2}}$.
  Put $\theta_{1} = \theta_{2} = \theta$ to find
  %
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
      \cos{2\theta} &= \cos^{2}{\theta} - \sin^{2}{\theta}\\
         &= \cos^{2}{\theta} - (1-\cos^{2}\theta)\\
         &= 2\cos^{2}{\theta} - 1.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation*}
  %
  A similar analysis reveals that $\sin2\theta = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}$.
  \qed
\end{solution}
\begin{example}[A biological question]
  A scientist has come across a plant which he feels is a new species. How will he go about its identification, classification and nomenclature?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  A newly identified species can be easily classified by taxonomic aids. The scientist has to do comparative studies of the morphological and anatomical features with the features of existing plants present in the taxonomical aids, and according to binomial nomenclature given by Carl Linnaeus, the species can be classified. Some of the taxonomical aids that can be used are flora, manuals, monographs, catalogues etc.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
  This is an example to test figures with transparent backgrounds.
  Such figures should have the same background color as the standout environment.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{example-image-a5}
  \end{center}
  And, as we see above, figures with transparent backgrounds do have the same color as the standout!
